<h2>Control Systems Testing</h2>
The experimental results of the proposed technique are
presented in this section. The results of the trial include the
required navigation channel, Avoid the Crowds, and Snack Run.
<h3>A. Mandatory Navigation Channel</h3>

The boat must navigate between the gates without colliding with any of the buoys in the required navigation channel. According to
the video, the boat navigates 6 feet away from the fence on its own. After adding several waypoints, the compass, GPS, and accelerometer automatically detect the navigation information
(heading, longitude, and latitude) and update the changes (latitude and longitude). The L1 control and PID controller will utilize this
information to alter speed and acceleration so that the boat stays on course. Furthermore. GPS data is used to create the visual user
interface.
<h3>B. Avoid the Crowds:</h3>

The ASV's capacity to detect task aspects with object recognition
and decision making is demonstrated in the Snack Run challenge.
This job displays the efficiency of the hull form in conjunction
with the propulsion system and the associated manoeuvrability.
The ASV enters through gate buoys as rapidly as possible, circles
the mark buoy (counter clockwise or clockwise), and escapes
through the same gate buoys.
