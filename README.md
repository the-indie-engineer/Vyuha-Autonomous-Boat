# Vyuha-Autonomous-Boat
The boat designed by team Vyuha representing
Bannari Amman Institute of technology features SWASH type
hull design to overcome the challenges in Roboboat 2022
competition. The team aims to build a boat with optimal
dimensional and design features to achieve the best possible
results in the event. The team worked on to clear the first three
tasks due to the time constraints along with the design and
feasible manufacturing techniques to reduce the cost factor. The
boat was designed and developed to provide better stability, quick
recognition over the environment and obstacles, quick reaction,
better maneuverability and control. The team developed the boat
with these design features to exhibit a good performance to
compete in the Roboboat 2022 event.
